|                   Class name & explanation                    | Reflection based on Clean Code Chapter 2 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **DataVisualizer** <br> The main class of the module                        | **Use Intention-Revealing Names:** It correctly gives the impression that it visualizes data somehow, but isn't really clear *how* it visualizes it. <br> **Use Pronounceable Names** It is easy to say/read to humans and is therefore easy to communicate to others about. |
| **ErrorHandler** <br> The class that creates and show errors in the console | **Avoid Disinformation:** The name can be a little confusing since the class only creates an Error object and consoles out an error, the word *Handler* can give the impression that it does more than what it actually do, for instance that it also is used for checking for errors. |
| **Chart** <br> The super class for all the chart classes                    | **Use Searchable Names:** I find the name pretty good since it creates and stores information for a generic chart (it does not visualize or build it but handles all the information) and it is easy to pronounce and understand. But since all my subclasses also have the word *Chart* in them and if you would search for the word *Chart* it will show ALL the other subclasses and maybe get lost in all the hits, but I think it is worth it for the positive things I mentioned here first. |

| [_drawPieChart()](https://github.com/JenniferVonT/DataVisualizer/blob/6c12250245f5d4e8a1b800a4311891c8a91c591a/src/chartModules/pieChart.js#L26-L84) | 45 | **Small!/Blocks and Indenting:** This is not a small method, it builds the visual aspect of the pie chart and I tried to refactor it but noticed that I couldn't send the canvas elements context as an argument without losing it and it becoming undefined so I noticed I had to do the same line of code in every new method changing the canvas element and didn't think it was worth it. I atleast managed keep the indentation/depth of the method under two. <br> **Do One Thing:** The function doesn't do just one thing, it both draws the pie chart but also does some calculations and checks whether what side is the longest, I could have refactored all the calculations atleast to make it both shorter and better follow the "Do one thing" rule. <br>  |
| [_drawLineGraph(amountOfDataPoints)](https://github.com/JenniferVonT/DataVisualizer/blob/6c12250245f5d4e8a1b800a4311891c8a91c591a/src/chartModules/lineChart.js#L26-L77) | 36 | **Use Descriptive Names:** I think the method name is appt but the same as the pie chart it does not do just one thing unfortunately, it does not just draw the line (and I accidentally named it graph here instead of following the established name chart). It makes the name a bit misleading, but it is not a major flaw and since the method is not public I'm not too worried about misleading a user of the module. I should've refactored all the calculations and only kept the methods that actually draws the chart though. <br> **Function Arguments:** It is a monadic method (one argument) but I noticed that I could've made it niladic (no arguments) since I can actually reach all the data points from within the method without the argument which would have been better. |
| [_drawColumns(amountOfColumns)](https://github.com/JenniferVonT/DataVisualizer/blob/6c12250245f5d4e8a1b800a4311891c8a91c591a/src/chartModules/columnChart.js#L33-L68) | 25 | **Verbs and Keywords:** It is a good pairing with the method name and arguments, the method draws the columns and you insert the amount of columns you want. <br> **Do One thing:** It does however (the same as the two previous methods) not do just one thing, it draws the actual columns, does some calculations and inserts text into the chart. It would be better to separate these into multiple methods instead. |
| [#isOptionsValid(options)](https://github.com/JenniferVonT/DataVisualizer/blob/6c12250245f5d4e8a1b800a4311891c8a91c591a/src/chartModules/chart.js#L100-L126) | 26 | **Argument Objects:** This method technically checks 3 arguments but to make it more coherent (and avoid a Triadic method) I have made the argument into an object (this object can include one or several of the options making it easy to use when checking one or several options at once), it is not very clear though what those options are when just reading the name. <br> **Use Descriptive Names:** I think the name is good and it does really just check the validity of all the options available. The *is* prefix signals that the return type is a boolean which this method does, it checks if the options is valid and returns true if they are or false if they aren't. <br> **Switch Statements:** It is a "large" method and this switch statement will grow with every new option that is added which is not good, but atleast all the cases calls methods that does the same or similar things, they all check the validity of the option value and they all return booleans that in turn affect the main methods return type. |
| [#createChart(typeofChart, dataPoints)](https://github.com/JenniferVonT/DataVisualizer/blob/6c12250245f5d4e8a1b800a4311891c8a91c591a/src/dataVisualizer.js#L119-L142) | 21 | **Dyadic Functions:** The method takes two arguments and typeofChart and dataPoints technically aren't related but they are important to build a chart, first we need to know what type of chart we are making, the second argument is optional and is a way to build the chart with several data points at the beginning (instead of having to insert them one by one afterwards), it is not very clear though that dataPoints is optional. <br> **Switch Statements:** The same as before, it does include a switch statement with three cases, this will also grow if other forms of charts/graphs are added to the module but I'm not expecting it to grow massively since there isn't that much more charts/graphs to create. All the cases do the same thing atleast but with different classes, they all instantiate Chart classes but with different subclasses. |
